# Speech-to-Speech-Interaction-using-LLM
Speech-to-Speech Interaction Using Large Language Models (LLM)
This project demonstrates a Speech-to-Speech interaction system that combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP) using GPT-2, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis.

Features:
Speech Recognition: Captures and transcribes user speech using the Google Speech Recognition API.

Natural Language Processing: Generates contextual responses with a pre-trained GPT-2 model.

Text-to-Speech Synthesis: Converts the generated text response into speech using pyttsx3.

Interactive Dialogue: Enables real-time, dynamic conversation.\

Technologies Used:
SpeechRecognition: For capturing and recognizing speech input.

Transformers (Hugging Face): For text generation using the GPT-2 model.

pyttsx3: For synthesizing and vocalizing responses.

Usage:
Run the script to initiate the system.
Speak into the microphone, and the system will process your input and respond in real-time.
This project showcases the integration of speech technologies and large language models to create seamless human-computer interaction.
